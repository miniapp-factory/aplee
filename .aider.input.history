+Technical Specification (TS) – Emotional & Psychological State Tracker App
+1. Project Overview
+
+The Emotional & Psychological State Tracker app is designed to help users monitor, record, and analyze their emotional and psychological well-being. The app allows users to log moods, track patterns over time, receive insights, and optionally set reminders for self-care or mental health activities.
+The goal is to increase self-awareness, identify triggers, and support personal mental health management.
+
+2. Functional Requirements
+2.1 Mood Logging
+
+Users can log their current emotional state multiple times per day.
+
+Each entry may include:
+
+Mood (select from predefined options, e.g., Happy, Sad, Anxious, Calm)
+
+Intensity (e.g., 1–10 scale)
+
+Notes or journal text
+
+Tags (e.g., Work, Family, Exercise, Sleep)
+
+Optional: location or activity context
+
+2.2 Psychological Metrics
+
+Track additional psychological factors:
+
+Stress level
+
+Energy level
+
+Sleep quality
+
+Anxiety or depressive symptoms (self-assessment scales)
+
+Optionally include short questionnaires (e.g., PHQ-9, GAD-7).
+
+2.3 Visualization & Analytics
+
+Daily, weekly, and monthly summaries of emotional patterns.
+
+Graphs and charts showing mood trends, intensity, and triggers.
+
+Correlations between mood and activities, sleep, or other factors.
+
+Highlight unusual or extreme patterns for self-awareness.
+
+2.4 Reminders & Notifications
+
+Optional notifications to prompt mood logging.
+
+Reminders for mindfulness exercises, meditation, or journaling.
+
+Configurable frequency and time of reminders.
+
+2.5 Journaling & Notes
+
+Users can write daily notes or journal entries.
+
+Optionally link notes to mood entries.
+
+Searchable text for reflection over time.
+
+2.6 Search & Filtering
+
+Search past entries by date, mood, tags, or keywords.
+
+Filter entries by mood category, intensity, or activity context.
+
+2.7 Privacy & Security
+
+Local storage of all entries by default.
+
+Optional cloud sync with encryption (end-to-end) for multi-device access.
+
+Optional passcode, fingerprint, or face authentication for privacy.
+
+2.8 User Interface
+
+Intuitive mood logging screen with simple emoji or slider selection.
+
+Dashboard for quick overview of mood trends.
+
+Calendar view showing entries over time.
+
+Graphical display for trends (line chart, bar chart, pie chart).
+
+Light/Dark mode and customizable themes.
+
+3. Non-Functional Requirements
+3.1 Platform
+
+Mobile app (iOS & Android recommended)
+
+Optional web version
+
+3.2 Performance
+
+Logging a mood entry must take <1 second.
+
+Dashboard and charts must load instantly (<0.5 seconds for 1000+ entries).
+
+3.3 Reliability
+
+Local data must persist reliably even if app is closed.
+
+Cloud sync must handle offline entries and conflicts gracefully.
+
+3.4 Usability
+
+Easy-to-use interface suitable for daily interaction.
+
+Minimal taps to log mood (<3 taps).
+
+Accessible design (readable fonts, colorblind-friendly palettes).
+
+4. Technical Stack
+Mobile
+
+Framework: Flutter or React Native
+
+Local database: SQLite, Realm, or Hive
+
+Notifications: native push / local notifications
+
+Web (Optional)
+
+Frontend: React / Vue.js
+
+Backend: Node.js / Django
+
+Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
+
+Optional PWA support for offline use
+
+Optional Analytics/AI
+
+Machine learning for mood pattern prediction or trend alerts.
+
+Suggest personalized interventions based on mood patterns.
+
+5. Future Enhancements
+
+Mood sharing with therapist or support group (optional).
+
+Integration with wearable devices (heart rate, sleep tracking).
+
+Guided meditation or mindfulness exercises.
+
+Gamification: streaks for regular logging.
+
+Export mood data for research or personal records (CSV, PDF).
